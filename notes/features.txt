# Express levels in percentages from the current price.
# HOw many levels to create? Consider volatility, fine granuality. But to lower frequencies, choose coarser granuality. Liquidity, 
# BUT this must be a hyperparameter to tune, mate
# Systematically test if features make sense by using machine learning models. Perhabs, it would be wiser to test them in bulk
# Do some correlation analysis. Do something like random forests, that automatically give you the relations.
# Categorize price movements into more general types.

Composite Metrics
# --- Volatility adjsuted depth : Order depth normalized by market volatility
# --- Price Momentum: The rate of price change combined with order book dynamics.
# --- Order Flow Imbalance: The difference between the number of buy orders and sell orders arriving within a given time frame.
# --- Liquidity Metrics: Ratios that measure market liquidity, such as the total volume of orders at the top 5 levels.
# --- The ratio of historical price volatility to order book depth, indicating how volatility impacts liquidity.
# --- Order Book Density: The concentration of orders within a specific price range.
# --- Order Book Slope: The rate of change in cumulative volume across price levels, indicating the steepness of the order book.
# --- Entropy of depth: Entropy of Order Book: A measure of the randomness or disorder in the distribution of orders across price levels.
# --- Fourier Transform of Depth: Analyzes the frequency components of order book changes to identify cyclical patterns.
# --- Fractal Dimension of Order Book: A measure of the complexity of the order book structure, indicating how detailed it is at different scales.
# --- Wavelet Transform : Identifying short-term volatility bursts or long-term trends.
# --- Hurst Exponent : Analyzing the persistence of trends in order book changes.
# --- Stochastic Differential Equations: Captures the stochastic nature of order arrivals and cancellations.
# --- Luapunov Exponent: Understanding the predictability of market movements.
# --- Stochastic differential equation
# --- Agent based modeling Helps in modeling the impact of different trading strategies on market dynamics.
# --- 
# --- Cluster everything you have
