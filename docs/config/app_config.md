# App Configuration Documentation

This document explains various configuration parameters used in the application.

## Initial Price Configuration

### `initial_price`

**Description:** Defines the initial price configuration needed to start the app.

**Parameters:**
- `symbol`: The trading pair symbol.
- `exchange`: The exchange where the symbol is traded.
- `instrument_type`: The type of instrument (e.g., perpetual).

## OKX Liquidation Settings Filter

### `okx_liquidations_filter`

**Description:** Settings related to OKX liquidation data filters.

**Parameters:**
- `instrument_types`: A list of instrument types to process (e.g., perpetual, future).
- `basecoin`: Basecoin to filter the data. If commented out, the symbols list will be used instead.
- `symbols`: A list of specific symbols to process. Uncomment and fill this list if filtering by symbols instead of basecoin.

## Fallback Symbols

### `fallback_symbols`

**Description:** A list of fallback symbols with their respective exchange and instrument type. If there is a stream that doesnâ€™t have the price metric but price is needed to merge, this price will be used as a proxy. There must also be a stream of trades with this exact symbol.

**Parameters:**
- `symbol`: The trading pair symbol.
- `exchange`: The exchange where the symbol is traded.
- `instrument_type`: The type of instrument (e.g., perpetual).

## Data Merge Types

### `data_merge_types`

**Description:** A list of data merge types used for various data operations.

**Available Data Merge Types:**

- `spot_depth`: Depth of the spot market order book.
- `future_depth`: Depth of the perpetual market order book.
- `spot_trades`: Trades occurring in the spot market.
- `future_trades`: Trades occurring in the futures market.
- `option_trades`: Trades occurring in the options market.
- `future_oi_delta`: Changes in open interest for perpetual and futures contracts.
- `future_liquidations`: Liquidation events in the perpetual nad future markets.
- `option_oi`: Open interest in options contracts.
- `spot_canceled_depth`: Canceled orders in the spot market order book.
- `future_canceled_depth`: Canceled orders in the futures market order book.
- `spot_reinforced_depth`: Reinforced depth of the spot market order book.
- `future_reinforced_depth`: Reinforced depth of the futures market order book.

## Merge Intervals

### `merge_intervals_seconds`

**Description:** Specifies the intervals (in seconds) for merging data for different types.

**Parameters:**
- `spot`: Interval for spot data.
- `future`: Interval for future data.
- `option`: Interval for option data.




## Option Data Aggregation Settings

### `option_data_aggregation`
- **Description**: Settings for aggregating option open_interest data based on price ranges and expiry windows.
- **Parameters**:
  - `price_ranges`: A list of price values to create ranges for aggregation. The list can start from 0 but it is not necessary. It will create ranges of prices to merge on, such as -inf to x, x to y, and so on.
  - `expiry_windows`: A list of expiry values to create windows for aggregation. This list must contain 0 and does not contain negative values.
  - `fallback_symbols`: A dictionary containing symbols for index prices of options.
- **Example**:
    ```yaml
    option_data_aggregation:
      price_ranges: [0, 50, 100, 150, 200]  # Aggregates option open_interest data based on price ranges
      expiry_windows: [0, 7, 14, 30, 60]  # Aggregates option open_interest data based on expiry windows
      fallback_symbols:
        BTCUSD:
          index_symbol: BTCUSD_INDEX
        ETHUSD:
          index_symbol: ETHUSD_INDEX
    ```




option_data_aggregation
This section defines settings for aggregating option open interest data based on price ranges and expiry intervals.

price_buckets: A list of price values to create ranges (buckets) for aggregation. The list can start from 0 but it is not necessary. It will create ranges of prices to merge on, such as -inf to x, x to y, and so on. Can be float
expiry_intervals: A list of expiry values to create intervals for aggregation. This list must contain 0 and does not contain negative values.
fallback_symbols: A dictionary containing symbols for index prices of options. Only integers
This structure uses the new variable names price_buckets and expiry_intervals to clearly describe the purpose of the data they represent.
